Hey students!
This is how you'll navigate VSCode and get your CodeStream assignments. In the terminal below, use this command:

`csosget get [lesson name]` 
ex: csosget get gd2_lesson1.2

and then the file will be downloaded to your github repo in the 'student-start-repo' home directory(aka folder)

from there, you will read the instructions in that files ReadMe.md or online on CSOS platform and complete the assignment in your codespace. Make sure youre in the correct directpry at all times. Youll know you are when in your terminal it has the directory name and the lesson name and then the $ for the prompt!

i.e.
@erikkacodestream âžœ /workspaces/template-repo (main) $
